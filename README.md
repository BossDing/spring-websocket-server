# Spring-based WebSocket Chat Server

Demonstrates Spring WebSocket Server. Sample code based off of [Spring Guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-stomp-websocket/) with a few changes.

The package includes a Web client which can be used to exercise the functionality. Build the software, run it, and connect to the client at: http:://<hostname>:8080/

For a demo Spring Java Client, see [https://github.com/jaysridhar/spring-websocket-client].
